       <p>Hello! My name is Star! I have been drawing for about 10 years as a hobby, and teaching myself new techniques. I like anime, cartoons, chocolate and plants, and im a part time animator for WHite Hare Productions! I can paint, draw traditionally or digitally, i can make charcoal portraits, and collages. You can find my instagram and a few examples of artwork at @moonie.love_draws. I also ocassionally post speed draws on youtube, on my chsnnel Star Speeddraws. </p>
